# AnneMary Raduva Portfolio Website - Development Progress

## Original User Problem Statement
User requested step-by-step improvements to AnneMary Raduva's climate activist portfolio website.

## Current Status: STEP 1 - Contact Section Implementation

### Tasks Completed:
âœ… **Added Missing Contact Section**
- Added complete Contact section with contact information
- Included contact form with proper styling  
- Added AnneMary's real contact details (phone, email, location)
- Added reference to her climate campaigns
- Created simple PHP contact handler (simple-contact.php)
- Started local web server on port 8080

### Current Issues Identified:
1. Contact form needs testing
2. Frontend supervisor service not running (but simple HTTP server works)
3. Need to validate contact form functionality

### Next Steps:
2. Fix inconsistencies across all pages (Alex Smith references)
3. Customize Portfolio section with real climate projects
4. Update Services section with relevant content
5. Add new sections or improvements
6. Design improvements and final touches

### Testing Protocol:
- Use simple HTTP server for testing static HTML
- Test contact form functionality manually
- Validate responsive design on different screen sizes

## File Changes Made:
- `/app/index.html` - Added Contact section after Testimonials
- `/app/forms/simple-contact.php` - Created simple contact form handler
- Server started on port 8080

## Technical Notes:
- This is a static HTML portfolio template, not a React/FastAPI app
- Using Bootstrap framework with vendor libraries
- Contact form uses PHP backend for message handling
