2. Fix inconsistencies across all pages (Alex Smith references)
3. Customize Portfolio section with real climate projects
4. Update Services section with relevant content
5. Add new sections or improvements
6. Design improvements and final touches

### Testing Protocol:
- Use simple HTTP server for testing static HTML
- Test contact form functionality manually
- Validate responsive design on different screen sizes

## File Changes Made:
- `/app/index.html` - Added Contact section after Testimonials
- `/app/forms/simple-contact.php` - Created simple contact form handler
- Server started on port 8080

## Technical Notes:
- This is a static HTML portfolio template, not a React/FastAPI app
- Using Bootstrap framework with vendor libraries
- Contact form uses PHP backend for message handling
