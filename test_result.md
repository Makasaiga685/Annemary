3. Customize Portfolio section with real climate projects
4. Update Services section with relevant content
5. Add new sections or improvements
6. Design improvements and final touches

### Testing Protocol:

- `/app/forms/simple-contact.php` - Created simple contact form handler
- Server started on port 8080

## Technical Notes:
- This is a static HTML portfolio template, not a React/FastAPI app
- Using Bootstrap framework with vendor libraries
- Contact form uses PHP backend for message handling
